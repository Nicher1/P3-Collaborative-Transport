## AAU University Project: Maintaining stable pressure on non-rigid materials during transport

Welcome to the AAU University project on maintaining stable pressure on non-rigid materials during transport! As part of Aalborg University's Robotic Engineering, 3rd semester group, we aim to develop a solution for maintaining consistent pressure on non-rigid materials during transport to ensure the quality and integrity of the material.

All relevant code for this project can be found in the Main folder located at the following link:
